# WhoToFollow
Google-chrome extension which provides additional information to twitter page. It's strength is simplicity,
no need for configuration, speed.

#Who is this extension for
This extension is for everyone who is trying (like me) to gain more twitter followers. Typical usecase for
gaining twitter followers without support of any 3rd party software is to browse followers of some account
with similar focus of yours.

However default twitter page doesn't show you stats of account unless you open their's page, that is problem, 
because you want to follow people who tends to re-follow, that means their following/followers ration is close 
to 1. **This extension provides functionality to see profile's number of tweets, followers, following and last activity.**
